## Problem Statement

The All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem is generally defined as the
following:

> Given a graph `G`, what is the shortest path between all pairs of vertices
in `G`?

**Example:** Given a city (graph) with junctions (vertices) and roads (edges), 
what is the shortest path from every junction in the city to all the other junctions?

## General Idea | $$ O(V^3) $$
