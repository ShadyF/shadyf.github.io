I recently discovered Jekyll and decided I should start a programming blog,
given all the notes and problem solutions I have accumulated on my desktop.

Heck, I'll even throw in some guides to spice things up a bit. Then maybe,
just maybe, someone else, other than me, would find this website useful.

So yeah, this blog is officially a thing.
