## Hello There! 

My name is Shady Fanous, I'm currently a **Computer Engineering**
Undergrad at _The American University in Cairo_. I'm in my senior years, expected to graduate in _Fall 2018_.

I'm an avid programmer with a constant desire to learn. I always find new challenges interesting,
and strive towards solving them. I love the web, game design, and spending relentless nights trying to
fix that one stubborn bug.
