## Hello There! 

My name is Shady Fanous, I'm currently a **Computer Engineering**
Undergrad at _The American University in Cairo_. I'm in my senior years, expected to graduate in _Fall 2018_.

I'm an avid programmer with a constant desire to learn. I always find new challenges interesting,
and strive towards solving them. I love the web, game design, and spending relentless nights trying to
fix that one stubborn bug.

## This Site

This website was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.
The theme is based on [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). 
You can checkout the source of this site [here](https://github.com/ShadyF/shadyf.github.io), on Github.

It doubles as my resume, and a place where I could write about any interesting challenges and projects I come across during my learning experience.

It'll contain a lot of solutions to competitive programming problems, 
a couple of code snippets here and there, my notes, and even some programming guides.

## Contact
I'm always open to meeting new people and helping whenever I can.
So whether it's for a general question, giving me some helpful feedback, or even some casual chit-chat,
feel free to hit me up at [sssfanous@gmail.com](mailto:sssfanous@gmail.com).
