## Theia

The original iteration of [**Theia-web**](https://theia-web.herokuapp.com/editor).
Despite having much less features than its web-based counterpart, it's a
cross-platform GUI application that allows the user to enter and process
images using their own custom 3x3 kernel matrices.

**Technologies Used:** Python3, Tkinter and Pillow.

## Competitive Programming Problems

I solve a _lot_ of competitive programming problems. You'll find the solutions
of numerous problems, along with my thought process, posted on my blog.
You can also find them on my [Github](https://github.com/ShadyF/Competitive_Programming_Problems).

**Technologies Used:** C++

## CRN Paster

AUC's course registration system can be a pain sometimes. Being a split-second
too late when manually typing in course registration numbers (CRN) will almost assuredly
mean some courses will fail to register due to them reaching their full capacity.
**CRN Paster** solves this problem by allowing the user to input all their CRNs and pastes
them all instantaniously with a press of a button.

I'm currently in the midst of re-implementing **CRN Paster** using [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/)
to fully automate the process.

**Technologies Used:** Python2, Tkinter
