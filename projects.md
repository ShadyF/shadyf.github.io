## Theia-web
A web-based image manipulation tool that allows its users to upload
and perform various manipulations on their chosen images, such as applying
transformations, Instagram-like color filters and kernel fitlers.

**Techonolgies Used:** Python3, Django, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax,
Bootstrap, ImageMagick and Pillow.

## Theia

The original iteration of [**Theia-web**](https://theia-web.herokuapp.com/editor).
Despite having much less features than its web-based counterpart, it's a
cross-platform GUI application that allows its users to enter and process
images using their own custom 3x3 kernel matrices.

**Technologies Used:** Python3, Tkinter and Pillow.

## Competitive Programming Problems

I solve a _lot_ of competitive programming problems. You'll find the solutions
of numerous problems, along with my thought process, posted on my blog.
You can also find them on my [Github](https://github.com/ShadyF/Competitive_Programming_Problems).

**Technologies Used:** C++

## CRN Paster

AUC's course registration system can be a pain sometimes. Being a split-second
too late when manually typing in course registration numbers (CRN) will almost assuredly
mean some courses will fail to register due to them reaching their full capacity.
**CRN Paster** solves this problem by allowing the user to input all their CRNs and pastes
them all instantaniously with a press of a button.

I'm currently in the midst of re-implementing **CRN Paster** using 
[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to fully automate the process.

**Technologies Used:** Python2, Tkinter

## Static Timing Analysis Tool

A [Static Timing Analysis Tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_timing_analysis)
for digital circuits. It identifies all the timing paths of a given circuit,
applies the Critical Path Method (CPM) on it, and outputs all timing violations (if any),
along with the slacks of each gate.

## Mini Game Console

An hardware implementation of both [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) 
and [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_\(video_game\))
on a FPGA board. Can be easily connected to any VGA enabled monitor and
feautures multiplayer with joystick support, an optional "Play against AI" mode,
and a hardware-implemented scoreboard.

**Team Members:** 2

**Technologies Used:** Verilog HDL, Xilinx Basys2 FPGA

## Advanced Pipelined MIPS Simulator

A GUI application that takes a set of MIPS instructions and displays the 
simulated/pipelined output, step by step.

**Team Members:** 4

**Technologies Used:** C++, Qt
